Assessment Question 2: Pick 2 items from the Test Scenario list and create the actual gherkin test.

Answer: Due to unclear instruction about how to answer and what is expected for this question, 
following actions has been taken-

	1) A sample Maven Mobile Automation Project has been created 
	2) Selenium, Appium and Cucumber has been used with Java
	3) All required jars and dependencies are added
	4) Sample gherkin test is added for 2 Scenario
	5) All required code to launch mobile application is included in BaseConfig class
	6) Separate Property file and how to read property file is also included
	7) Test Runner script is included
	9) Sample smoke test script is also included.
	10) Assessment Question 1, 3, 4 answers are included in a separate forlder withing this same project 
	for better sharing through Github.
	
Note: I did not found Chase Bank apk or ipa file for mobile testing.  so I could not include complete 
automation code and scripts for the Scenario. But the format, structure, and sample code is included 
within this project. I hope my project setting, structure, format etc. techniques will help you  determine 
my technical skills and qualifications for this role.


Please feel free to reach me for any further instructions and concerns.

Assessment Question 4: Consider HTML snippet below for an element whose id is changing
dynamically in different executions as:

	<input name=ChaseBank1234454454>; </input>
	<input name=ChaseBank90980989979> </input>
	<input name=ChaseBank_fdfdfdfdfdfddf> </input>

How do you handle the above situation and write a generic locator to match any of the above locators?

Answer:  I will use Xpath locator to identify above situation.  There are 2 ways we can write Xpath as generic locator for this situation.

	1)	//*[contains(@name,'ChaseBank')]
	2)	//*[starts-with(@name,'ChaseBank')]
